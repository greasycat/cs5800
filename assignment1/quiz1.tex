\section{Q1.2}

Initialization:
Before the first iteration starts, no elements have been checked, thus subarray of checked items is empty, so the invariant holds.

Maintenance:
During the loop, after each iteration i, the algorithm has checked the i elements. If item is found in any of these elements, the function returns True and terminates. Otherwise, the algorithm proceeds to the next iteration. The invariant holds.

Termination:
When the loop finishes, if the element x was found, the search ends (invariant still holds). If the loop terminates without finding x, the invariant ensures x is not present in the list.
