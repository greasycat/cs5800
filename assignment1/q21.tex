\section{Question 2-1}
Given $f(n) = n^{1.01}$ and $g(n) = n\log(n)^2$, determine the relationship between $f(n)$ and $g(n)$.

\section{Answer}
We will first assume that $f(n) = O(g(n))$. This means that there exists a constant $c > 0$ and $n_0 > 0$ such that $f(n) \leq c \cdot g(n)$ for all $n \geq n_0$.

\begin{align*}
f(n) &\leq c \cdot g(n) \\
n^{1.01} &\leq c \cdot n\log(n)^2 \\
n^{0.01} &\leq c \cdot \log(n)^2 \\
\frac{n^{0.01}}{log(n)^2} &\leq c
\end{align*}

Then we will can find the limit of the right hand side of the inequality to be infinity, as $n$ approaches infinity.

\begin{align*}
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n^{0.01}}{log(n)^2} &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{0.01n^{0.01}}{2\log(n)} \tag{L'Hopital}\\
&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{0.0001n^{0.01}}{2} \\
&= \infty
\end{align*}

However, such a constant $c$ does not exist, as the limit of the right hand side of the inequality is infinity. Therefore, it contradicts the assumption that $f(n) = O(g(n))$.

Next we will assume that $f(n) = \Omega(g(n))$. This means that there exists a constant $c > 0$ and $n_0 > 0$ such that $f(n) \geq c \cdot g(n)$ for all $n \geq n_0$.

\begin{align*}
f(n) &\geq c \cdot g(n) \\
n^{1.01} &\geq c \cdot n\log(n)^2 \\
n^{0.01} &\geq c \cdot \log(n)^2 \\
\frac{n^{0.01}}{log(n)^2} &\geq c
\end{align*}

Such a constant $c$ exists, as shown by the limit of the right hand side of the inequality.

then we can pick $c = \frac{10^{10}}{1000^2log(10)^2}$ and $n_0 = 10^{1000}$ to satisfy the inequality.

Therefore, $f(n) = \Omega(g(n))$. Since $f(n) = \Omega(g(n))$ and $f(n) \ne O(g(n))$ we can conclude that $f(n) \ne \Theta(g(n))$.
